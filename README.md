# Project 0: Titanic Dataset Analysis

Welcome to Project 0! This project is the final step in your onboarding and serves as your competency check to become a **Project Analyst** in the Data Science Department.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate your foundational skills in data loading, manipulation, and visualization using Python, `pandas`, and `seaborn` within a Google Colab environment.

## The Dataset: `titanic.csv`
You will be working with the classic Titanic dataset, located in the `/dataset` folder. This file contains demographic and travel information for passengers aboard the Titanic, as well as whether or not they survived the disaster. It is a clean, easy-to-use dataset perfect for practicing fundamental analysis skills.

## Your Task
Your task is to answer a series of questions about the Titanic passengers. You will write the code and provide your answers inside the `template.ipynb` notebook file. The notebook has been pre-populated with the questions and has cells for you to write your code.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Follow these steps precisely to complete and submit your project.

### Step 1: Get the Project Files
You need to get the files from this repository onto your computer.

-   **Action:** Click the green **`< > Code`** button at the top of this page, then select **`Download ZIP`**. Unzip the downloaded file on your computer.

### Step 2: Open and Work in Google Colab
We will use Google Colab to ensure everyone has the same working environment.

-   **Action:**
    1.  Go to your Google Drive.
    2.  Open the `template.ipynb` file you just downloaded. Google Drive will automatically prompt you to open it with Google Colaboratory.
    3.  When the notebook is open in Colab, you will need to upload the `titanic.csv` dataset to your Colab environment. The first code cell inside the notebook provides two common methods to do this. **Follow the instructions in the notebook.**

### Step 3: Complete the Analysis
All of your work will be done inside the `template.ipynb` notebook.

-   **Action:**
    1.  Read the markdown cells containing the questions carefully.
    2.  Write your Python code in the code cells provided below each question to produce the answer.
    3.  Ensure your code runs correctly and that the output (e.g., a number, a table, or a plot) is visible.

### Step 4: Share Your Completed Notebook
Once you have answered all the questions, you need to generate a shareable link to your notebook. This is a critical step.

-   **Action:**
    1.  In your Google Colab notebook, click the **`Share`** button in the top-right corner.
    2.  Under "General access," change the setting from "Restricted" to **`Anyone with the link`**.
    3.  Ensure the role is set to **`Viewer`**.
    4.  Click **`Copy link`**.

### Step 5: Submit Your Project
Submit the link you just copied via our official Google Form.

-   **Action:**
    1.  Go to the [**Project 0 Submission Form**](https://forms.gle/YOUR_FORM_LINK_HERE).
    2.  Fill in your name and email.
    3.  Paste the shareable link to your notebook in the appropriate field.
    4.  Submit the form.
